# Holberton Mastermind Challenge.
---------------------------------

## ○ How to Play - What is the Mastermind game?
Mastermind consists of two players, the code maker and the code braker. The code maker has to create a code, typically an
arrangement of 4 differed colored game tokens. The code braker's role is to try to figure out the color sequence, they have
a limited number of tries. Everytime the code braker makes a mess, the code maker will inform the code braker via 2 different
colors tokens how close they came to cracking the code. You can see in the picture below a line with black and white tokens,
one color will represent colored tokens placed in the correct place/color and the other color will indicate correct color but
wrong placement in the code.

For example, according to the image below:

If the code is ```red blue green pink``` and the code braker guesses ``red green blue pink`` then the code maker will place 2 black
tokens and 2 white ones. Since 2 are in the right place and 2 are the right color but wrong location.

## ○ The Challenge:
Develop at least one version Mastermind in the language of your choice. Each game can be one player (against a bot) or 2 players.
You are free of the number of columns, colors and turns.

## ○ List of langages used:
* Java

## ○ Java
I used Java 14 to write a program that allows an user to play Masterming against a bot.


* Piece of code related to the algorithm or flow
* Screenshots of the game
* Presentation of the language
* Algorithm put in place
